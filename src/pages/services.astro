      <h2>The Power of Hand-Built Websites</h2>
      <p>
        In the world of web development, not all websites are created equal.
        While WordPress and page builders may seem like convenient solutions,
        they often fall short when it comes to performance, flexibility, and
        long-term value. That's where our hand-built websites shine.
